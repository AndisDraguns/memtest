class MastermindEnv(gym.Env):
    """
    OpenAI Gym type of enviromnent class.

    This is an implementation of the board game "Mastermind":
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

    At each step the agent tries to guess the pattern of 4 hidden peg colours
    and order by putting up 4 code pegs. The environment outputs observation
    with white key peg for each correct colour but wrong place code peg and a
    black key peg for each correct colout and right place code peg.

    Action: a guess for the hidden code pegs
    Observation: counters for white and black pegs

    Customisability:
        By default the environment fits the simple description above,
        but it can also be customised by changing some of its parameters.
        By defauly there are 6 code peg colours and 12 guesses. Also
        the reward by default is given only when the game is won.
        All of this can be changed.

    Changeable variables:
        This environment is customisable by changing some of its parameters.

        max_guesses (int): controls how many guesses there can be.
        n_colours (int): controls how many colours of code pegs there are.
        n_pegs (int): controls how many code peg slots there are.
        white_reward (float): is the reward that the agent receives for each
            white peg observed.
        black_reward (float): is the reward that the agent receives for each
            black peg observed.
        win_reward (float): is the reward that the agent receives if
            the guess is correct.

    Observation (by default):
        Type: Box(2)

    Actions (by default):
        Type: Discrete(1296)
