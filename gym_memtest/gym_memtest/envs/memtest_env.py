class MemTestEnv(gym.Env):
    """
    OpenAI Gym type of enviromnent class.

    Description:
        At each step a coin is flipped and the agent is rewarded if it
        guesses correctly what the result of the coin flip was two steps
        ago. To solve this problem better than guessing at random, the
        agent requires some form of memory.

    Customisability:
        By default the environment fits the simple description above,
        but it can also be customised by changing some of its parameters.
        The coin can be changed into a dice, allowing more than two
        possible outcomes at each step. The number of steps the agent
        should look back for the correct guess can be changed as well.

    Definitions:
        Dice roll - the outcome of a coin flip where number of actions
            in the environment is changed to some integer amount
            corresponding to the sides of a dice.
        Warmup phase - the first few steps where the agent has not yet
            taken enough steps for there to be a dice roll enough steps
            in the past for the agent to guess. For example, the agent
            could not guess what was the result of the dice roll 5 steps
            ago while being at the first step.
        Game phase - the steps that are not in the warmup phase.

    Changeable variables:
        This environment is customisable by changing some of its parameters.
        offset (int): controls how many steps ago was the coin flip that the
            agent currently has to guess.  If set to 1, the agent just has to
            output the action corresponding to the observation - this requires
            no memory.
        max_time (int): controls how many guesses there can be, excluding the
            warmup phase. For example, if set to 100, the sum of the rewards
            in an episode corresponds to the percent of correct guesses in
            the game phase.
        act_dim (int): controls how many outcomes of the dice roll can there
            be - it can change the coin into a dice. This also corresponds to
            the number of actions that the agent can take - its guess can be
            any side of the dice.
        obs_dim (int) by default it 1 - corresponding to the one boolean value
            of the current coin flip - 0 for heads and 1 for tails. Change
            this to some other positive integer to return an array of the
            current result filling all cells of the array. This might be
            useful for easier compatibility with algorithms working with
            observation space dimensions differring from 1.
        neutral_reward (float): is the reward that the agent receives at each
            step while in the warmup phase.
        negative_reward (float): is the reward that the agent receives if
            guess is incorrect and the game phase has already started.
        positive_reward (float): is the reward that the agent receives if
            guess is correct and the game phase has already started.

    Observation (by default):
        Type: Box(1)
        0 - coin comes up as heads
        1 - coin comes up as tails

    Actions (by default):
        Type: Discrete(2)
        0 - guess that coin came up heads two turns ago
        1 - guess that coin came up tails two turns ago
