    """
    OpenAI Gym type of enviromnent class.

    Description:
        At each step a random floating point number is generated.
        The agent is rewarded in proportion to how close it guesses
        what the result of the generation was two steps ago. To do
        better than guessing at random, the agent requires some form
        of memory.

    Customisability:
        By default the environment fits the simple description above,
        but it can also be customised by changing some of its parameters.
        For example, the number of steps the agent should look back for
        the correct guess can be changed.

    Definitions:
        Generation - the product of the random number generator that
            is generated at each step.
        Warmup phase - the first few steps where the agent has not yet
            taken enough steps for there to be a generation enough steps
            in the past for the agent to guess. For example, the agent
            could not guess what was the result of the generation 5 steps
            ago while being at the first step.
        Game phase - the steps that are not in the warmup phase.

    Changeable variables:
        This environment is customisable by changing some of its parameters.
        offset (int): controls how many steps ago was the generation that the
            agent currently has to guess. If set to 1, the agent just has to
            output the action corresponding to the observation - this requires
            no memory.
        max_time (int): controls how many guesses there can be, excluding the
            warmup phase.
        obs_dim (int) by default it 1 - corresponding to the one float value
            of the current generation. Change this to some other positive
            integer to return an array of the current generation filling all
            cells of the array. This might be useful for easier compatibility
            with algorithms working with observation space dimensions
            differring from 1.
        neutral_reward (float): is the reward that the agent receives at each
            step while in the warmup phase.
        min_state (float): the lowest value that can be generated
        max_state (float): the highest value that can be generated

    Observation (by default):
        Type: Box(1)
        min: 0.0
        max: 1.0

    Actions (by default):
        Type: Box(1)
        min: 0.0
        max: 1.0
